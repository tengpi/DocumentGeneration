• Actionable Recommendations:
  - Guide to Investment Entry: Contact her via Phone (aligning with her preferred channel) and mention, "We noticed you’ve been paying attention to investment themes recently. Although you value asset safety, you can try allocating a small portion of cash to low-risk products, such as money market funds — they offer higher returns than fixed deposits and are flexible enough," lowering the investment threshold to match her safety preference.
  - Strengthen Protection Planning: Targeting her protection goal, send materials for a "Family Comprehensive Protection Plan" (e.g., critical illness insurance + children’s education fund insurance) via Email, emphasizing, "You need to support your children; multi-layered protection can reduce the pressure of medical and education expenses." Later, send a product calculation tool via App to facilitate her independent understanding.
  - Guide to Tool Usage: Since she has not visited Wealth Master, suggest via Phone, "You can use the tutorials in the App or make an appointment to visit the branch. We’ll teach you to use this tool to view cash distribution and help you plan protection and savings goals," matching her preference for App usage.


[Wealth Portfolio]
• Personalized Investment Recommendations:
  - Low-Risk Cash Appreciation: Recommend Hong Kong Dollar money market funds (high liquidity, higher yields than fixed deposits, extremely low risk). It is suggested to allocate 20%-30% of cash to such funds, which can be redeemed at any time via App. This aligns with her "Security Guru" attribute while realizing cash appreciation.
  - Trial of Protection-Oriented Investments: Combining her focus on environmental protection, recommend "green bonds" (e.g., Bloomberg Asian Dollar Green Investment-Grade Bonds, up 3.7% YTD with a yield of 4.7%). It is suggested to allocate 10%-15% of cash to these bonds, emphasizing, "These bonds support environmental protection projects, offer stable returns, and align with your focus on environmental protection," increasing her acceptance of investment.
• Asset Allocation Adjustment Suggestions:
  - Cash Ratio Optimization: Adjust the 100% cash allocation to "70% emergency cash (covering 6-12 months of family expenses) + 20% money market funds + 10% green bonds". This not only retains a sufficient safety buffer but also adds low-risk investments, matching her dual needs for safety and appreciation.
  - Gradually Enrich Product Categories: After her risk rating is confirmed, if she can tolerate low risk, add an additional 5%-8% of low-volatility funds (e.g., global balanced funds) to further achieve diversified allocation of "cash + money market funds + bonds + funds" and strengthen asset safety.
• Portfolio Optimization Opportunities:
  - Automate Savings and Investment: Recommend setting up "automatic monthly transfer of 5%-8% from current deposits to money market funds". This accumulates funds through mandatory savings, aligns with her habit of using credit cards for savings and investment, and requires no manual operations.
  - Family Expense Management: Push a "family budget management tool" via App to help her plan fixed expenses such as tuition and medical costs. Simultaneously, remind her, "Idle funds earmarked for expenses can be transferred to low-risk products to improve fund utilization," matching the financial needs of a housewife.
