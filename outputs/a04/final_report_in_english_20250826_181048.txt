[Customer Profile]  
• The customer is a married female aged 51-60, a Hong Kong resident, and a homemaker with a university education. She opened a new account in April 2025 (new customer) and has a close relationship with her account manager (familiarity level: Intimate Plus). Her lifestyle preference is "Luxury Hotel," and she is in the "Legacy Planning" life stage. She is health-conscious (proposition: Health-conscious), with credit card spending primarily focused on "Family with Kids," indicating family expenses are her core financial priority. She has purchased the "Prestige Private" voluntary medical insurance plan, demonstrating strong awareness of protection.  
• In terms of financial characteristics, the customer is a salary account holder with a total relationship balance (TRB) of HKD 50k–100k. She holds bond and fund investment products (hldg_INV_BOND: Y, hldg_INV_FUND: Y), with asset allocation predominantly in money market instruments (40%) and bonds (14%), resulting in high liquidity. She has upcoming maturing products (HKD 100K–300K) and faces service expiration risks (expire_risk: Y), requiring priority follow-up.  
• Action Recommendations: 1) Leverage her "Legacy Planning" life stage to proactively discuss wealth inheritance solutions, such as family trusts or life insurance planning; 2) Follow up on reinvestment needs for upcoming maturing products and offer stable product options; 3) Review terms of expiring services to ensure the continuity of medical insurance or investment entitlements; 4) Align with her "Health-conscious" trait to introduce health management value-added services or healthcare-related investment targets.  


[Wealth Portfolio]  
• Personalised Investment Advice: The customer’s current asset allocation (money market 40%, bonds 14%, equities 21%, other 24%) leans towards stability, matching her age and risk appetite. It is recommended to reference the "Steady Portfolio" (global bonds 35%, Asian bonds 23%, equities 14%) for moderate optimisation to enhance long-term returns.  
• Asset Allocation Adjustment Recommendations: 1) For the upcoming maturing funds of HKD 100K–300K, increase holdings in the "Bloomberg Asian USD Investment Grade Bond Index" (up 5.8% year-to-date, yielding 4.6%) to capitalise on the recent strong performance of the Asian bond market; 2) With existing equities accounting for 21%, consider adding funds focused on mainland China’s consumer or healthcare sectors, aligning with her "Family with Kids" spending habits and health concerns; 3) The 40% allocation to money market instruments is relatively high;建议 reallocate 10%–15% to short-term wealth management products to improve returns on idle funds.  
• Portfolio Optimisation Opportunities: 1) As the customer does not hold structured products, introduce low-risk structured deposits (e.g., interest rate-linked) to balance returns and stability; 2) In line with her "INVESTMENT_PROPERTY" financial goal, promote Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) to reduce the capital burden of direct property purchases; 3) Establish a quarterly portfolio review mechanism to ensure alignment with wealth inheritance and asset appreciation objectives.
