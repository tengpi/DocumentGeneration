[Wealth Portfolio]  
• [Personalized Investment Recommendations]: With a Risk Profiling Questionnaire (RPQ) rating of 1 (low risk) and classified as a "Moderate Asset Allocator", her existing structured products can be paired with low-volatility products to balance risk. Recommend referencing the "Stable Portfolio" (low to moderate risk) allocation, adding Asian USD investment-grade bonds (Bloomberg Index yield .46%, up 3.3% over 3 months ) or money market funds to improve cash utilization efficiency.  
• [Asset Allocation Adjustment Recommendations]: Cash allocation of .4%26 is excessively high . It is recommended to reallocate 10%-15% of cash to low-risk bonds or short-term time deposits (e.g., Hang Seng HKD Time Deposit Offer), retaining liquidity while boosting returns. For the investment portion, moderately increase bond funds (e.g., Global Developed Markets Corporate Bond Index, up 7.4% year-to-date) to reduce reliance on a single structured product.  
• [Portfolio Optimization Opportunities]: The customer holds investment products, but the asset class is marked as N/A; a review of the maturity dates and return performance of existing structured products is required. In alignment with her retirement goal (fhc_goal_type), recommend regular fixed-amount investments in retirement-themed funds (e.g., Balanced Portfolio with a 5-year cumulative return of 39.1%) to achieve long-term stable growth.
