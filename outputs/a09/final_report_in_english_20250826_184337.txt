[Customer Profile]  
• The client is a married female aged 41-50, serving as a company director with children, in the "Family with Kids" life stage. Her lifestyle focuses on "Legacy Planning," indicating she places significant emphasis on family protection and wealth inheritance. As a long-standing "Prestige" client of the Bank (account opened in 2005), she maintains a close relationship with her Relationship Manager (Intimate & warm client). She prefers communication via phone and frequently uses the mobile App; over the past month, she has browsed digital content related to foreign exchange, investments, and insurance, reflecting her proactive approach to financial planning.  
• Although the client has purchased Voluntary Health Insurance (VHIS), she does not hold other insurance products, which is somewhat mismatched with her "Legacy Planning" needs and family responsibilities. Her risk assessment (RPQ Level) has expired, which may affect the suitability of investment strategies. Additionally, a service/contract is soon to expire (expire_risk: Y), so follow-up should be arranged as early as possible. Furthermore, she frequently travels for business (bustrip: Y) and owns pets, presenting an opportunity to discuss travel protection and pet-related financial planning needs.  


[Wealth Portfolio]  
• Personalised Investment Recommendations: The client’s investment assets account for 88.22% of her portfolio (primarily structured products and bonds), with cash at 11.78%, but she does not hold any funds or foreign exchange products. Considering her "Legacy Planning" goals and family responsibilities, it is recommended that after updating the risk assessment, appropriate allocation be made to stable growth funds (such as Asia-Pacific dividend funds) to diversify the investment portfolio. In addition, her digital footprint indicates interest in foreign exchange, so foreign exchange wealth management products related to the strengthening Renminbi (e.g., offshore Renminbi fixed deposits) can be introduced.  
• Asset Allocation Adjustment Recommendations: The current investment portfolio is concentrated in structured products and bonds, with insufficient diversification in equity assets. With reference to the "Balanced Portfolio" (moderate risk), consideration can be given to reallocating maturing funds from some structured products (the soon-to-mature MXI product) to appropriately increase the proportion of global equity funds (such as European and American blue-chip equity funds) to 15-20%, balancing long-term growth and risk. Maintain bond allocations (e.g., Asian USD investment-grade bonds, up 1.4% in the past month) for stable returns.  
• Portfolio Optimisation Opportunities: The structured products held by the client will mature soon (within the next two months). It is recommended to proactively evaluate product performance and alternative options, prioritising structured products aligned with current market themes (e.g., linked to A-shares or the real estate sector). The cash portion (11.78%) can be appropriately converted into short-term money market instruments to enhance returns on idle funds. Review the bond holding ratio; in light of Singapore’s low inflation environment (July CPI up 0.6%), increase holdings of high-quality Asian corporate bonds to lock in stable coupon income.  


[Market News]  
• **A-share Rally Boosts Renminbi Demand**: While US stocks pulled back, Hong Kong stocks performed strongly (Hang Seng Index up 1.9%). The Renminbi rose to a near one-month high due to the strengthening A-shares and easing US-China tariffs; technically, USD/CNH is expected to test the 7.1 level.  
  Relevance: The client has a digital footprint indicating interest in foreign exchange but does not hold foreign exchange products; this trend presents an opportunity for foreign exchange allocation.  
  Action Recommendation: Suggest discussing offshore Renminbi asset allocation, such as purchasing Renminbi-denominated short-term bonds or structured deposits, to capitalise on potential exchange rate appreciation.  

• **Shanghai Announces Multiple Optimised Real Estate Measures**: Policies such as the cancellation of purchase restrictions outside Shanghai’s outer ring road and increased provident fund loan limits have been introduced to stimulate property market demand, which is expected to drive the performance of mainland real estate sectors and related investment products.  
  Relevance: As a company director, the client may be concerned about macroeconomic impacts on businesses and investments; relaxed real estate policies may benefit related sector funds.  
  Action Recommendation: Introduce structured products or sector ETFs linked to leading mainland real estate enterprises as a diversification option for the portfolio.  

• **Singapore’s July CPI Rose by Only 0.6% YoY**: Reduced inflationary pressures in Asia are conducive to central banks maintaining accommodative monetary policies, supporting bond market performance (Bloomberg Asian USD Investment Grade Bond Index up 1.4% in the past month).  
  Relevance: The client holds bond products; the low inflation environment is conducive to stable bond prices.  
  Action Recommendation: Suggest increasing holdings of Asian USD investment-grade bonds and appropriately extending bond duration to lock in higher yields while mitigating short-term interest rate volatility risks.n
