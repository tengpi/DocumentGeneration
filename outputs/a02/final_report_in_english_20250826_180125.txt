[Customer Profile]  
• **Customer Core Characteristics Analysis**: Retired female over 60 years old, married, Mainland Chinese client (non-Hong Kong resident). Has an intimate and warm relationship with the relationship manager (Intimate & warm client), but has not received a phone call from the manager in the past 3 months. Has dependent children and pets; main credit card expenditure is on tuition, indicating ongoing family financial responsibilities. Holds "Prestige Private" wealth management status; insurance surrender value ranges from 100K–500K with annual premiums of 10K–50K, but has not purchased Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS), resulting in a medical protection gap. Some services are about to expire (expire_risk: Y) and require timely follow-up. Prefers telephone communication (preferred_channel: Phone); recent digital footprints in foreign exchange (FX) and investments (INV) indicate ongoing attention to wealth management developments.  
• **Action Recommendations**: ① Prioritise contacting the client via phone (aligning with her preferred channel), express concern about her retirement life and pet status, and naturally transition to renewal plans for expiring services; ② In response to tuition expenses and dependent children needs, review whether the existing insurance portfolio (e.g., education funds, child protection) is adequate; ③ Promote the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS) to address post-retirement medical expense risks, emphasising the "protection first" philosophy.  


[Wealth Portfolio]  
• **Personalised Investment Recommendations**: The client’s investment assets account for 57.95% (all structured products), with cash at 42.05%, indicating a highly concentrated portfolio (lacking underlying assets such as funds and bonds). Considering her risk rating RPQ 3 (moderate risk tolerance) and retirement goal (fhc_goal_type: Retirement), it is recommended to gradually introduce low-volatility bond products (e.g., Asian USD investment-grade bonds, referencing the Bloomberg Asian USD Investment Grade Bond Index, which has risen 5.8% year-to-date) to diversify structured product risks; additionally, utilise the soon-to-mature CPI product (recent_maturity) to reallocate some funds to conservative funds (e.g., global high-quality bond funds) to enhance long-term return stability.  
• **Asset Allocation Adjustment Recommendations**: The current allocation of "Structured Products 57.95% + Cash 42.05%" can be optimised to "Structured Products 40% + Bonds 15% + Cash 35% + Low-Risk Funds 2%". Specific actions: ① Reallocate 20% of matured structured product funds to bonds (the client holds bonds at other banks, indicating acceptance); ② Reallocate 5% from cash to money market funds to enhance returns on idle funds; ③ Maintain 35% cash to meet liquidity needs (e.g., children’s tuition, emergency medical expenses).  
• **Portfolio Optimisation Opportunities**: ① The client has not used the Wealth Master tool (WM_visit: N); guide her to experience the asset analysis function via the Mobile App (favor_channel) to visually demonstrate the volatility reduction effect of diversified investments; ② In light of her mortgage loan exceeding 3 million (mortgage: Y), combined with recent Shanghai property optimisation policies, evaluate the feasibility of mortgage rate renegotiation or refinancing to reduce interest expenses; ③ Recommend gradually transferring bond assets from other banks (fhc_offus_wealth: BOND) to our bank to enjoy exclusive bond pricing benefits for "Prestige Private" clients.  


[Market News]  
• **A-share Rally Boosts Renminbi Demand** (Foreign Exchange Market): Recent sustained A-share gains have reached a near 10-year high, driving the renminbi exchange rate to a one-month high, with USD/CNH testing the 7.1 support level. The State Council may promote the internationalisation of renminbi stablecoins, further enhancing renminbi attractiveness. **Client Relevance**: The client holds foreign exchange products (hldg_FX: Y) and has foreign exchange digital footprints (digital_FX: Y), requiring attention to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on assets. **Action Recommendations**: If the client has renminbi funding needs (e.g., Mainland living expenses), consider converting part of her US dollars to renminbi at an opportune time to lock in favourable exchange rates; simultaneously allocate foreign exchange-linked structured deposits to hedge exchange rate risks.  
• **Shanghai Announces Multiple Optimised Property Measures** (Mainland Economy): Shanghai has relaxed purchase restrictions outside the outer ring road, increased provident fund loan limits, and unified mortgage rates from 26 August, which is expected to stimulate property market demand and stabilise housing prices. **Client Relevance**: The client holds a mortgage loan exceeding 3 million; loosening property policies may enhance repayment flexibility. **Action Recommendations**: Evaluate the client’s mortgage contract terms; if it is a floating rate, consult the bank’s mortgage team on the possibility of switching to a lower interest rate scheme; if the client has idle funds, consider partial early repayment to reduce total interest expenses.  
• **Singapore’s July CPI Rises by Only 0.6% YoY** (Asian Economy): Singapore’s core inflation fell to 0.5%, indicating reduced inflationary pressures in Asia, providing room for central banks to maintain accommodative monetary policies, which is positive for the bond market (especially Asian USD bonds). **Client Relevance**: The client holds bonds at other banks, and her retirement goal requires stable cash flow; in a low inflation environment, bond yields are relatively more attractive. **Action Recommendations**: Recommend allocating to Bloomberg Asian USD Investment Grade Bond Funds (up 5.8% year-to-date with a 4.6% yield), which offer both stable coupons and moderate price growth potential, aligning with her retirement cash flow needs.n
