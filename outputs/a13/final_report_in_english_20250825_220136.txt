• Actionable Recommendations:
  - Supplement Core Information: Send a customer questionnaire via EDM (noting "Receive gaming peripheral gifts after completion" to align with his gaming hobby) to collect information such as preferred channels and risk tolerance. Later, send questionnaire reminders via Mobile App to ensure data completeness for matching services.
  - Introductory Basic Protection: Targeting his lack of VHIS, recommend entry-level Voluntary Health Insurance via EDM, emphasizing "Young people also need to care about health — this plan has low premiums and covers basic hospitalization needs". Send a product calculation tool via Mobile App to lower the decision-making threshold.
  - Initiate Education Reserve: Combine his education goal, send a "Monthly Education Regular Investment Plan Starting from HKD 500" (e.g., money market funds) via EDM, mentioning "Start saving early to ease future education expenses". Follow up on registration intentions via Mobile App afterward.


[Wealth Portfolio]
• Personalized Investment Recommendations:
  - Introductory Cash Appreciation: Recommend Hong Kong Dollar money market funds (high liquidity, higher returns than current deposits, low risk). It is suggested to allocate 30%-40% of cash to such funds, which can be redeemed at any time via Mobile App. This aligns with his young age and preference for mobile operations, without bearing high risks.
  - Education Regular Investment Planning: Targeting his education goal, recommend a monthly fixed-amount investment of HKD 500-1,000 in global education-themed funds (e.g., tracking the consumer sector of developed markets, linked to education-related industries). Set up automatic deductions via Mobile App to enforce savings and reduce the impact of market fluctuations.
• Asset Allocation Adjustment Suggestions:
  - Cash Ratio Optimization: Adjust the 100% cash allocation to "60% emergency cash (covering 3-6 months of living expenses) + 40% low-risk products (money market funds + education regular investments)". This not only retains liquidity but also initiates investment and reserve planning, matching his small-scale funds and low-risk needs.
  - Gradually Enrich Product Categories: After his risk rating is confirmed, if he can tolerate low risk, add an additional 10%-15% of short-term bond products (e.g., products related to the Bloomberg Asian Dollar Investment-Grade Bond Index with a yield of 4.7%) to further improve returns.
• Portfolio Optimization Opportunities:
  - Link Mobile Payment with Investment: Leverage his "Mobile Payment User" attribute to launch a "Cashback from Consumption to Investment" function on the Mobile App (e.g., 1% cashback from each mobile payment into the regular investment account) to encourage the development of investment habits.
  - Link with Gaming-Themed Products: When launching gaming industry ETFs in the future, prioritize pushing relevant information via EDM (noting "Exclusive Analysis Report for Gaming Enthusiasts") to drive investment participation through his interests.
