[Customer Profile]  
• The customer is a male non-resident from Mainland China aged 51-60, who opened an account in 2019 and is a "Prestige Private" client. He maintains a close relationship with the account manager (Intimate & warm client) and has a high level of engagement with the bank (imodel_seg: Intimate), indicating a long-term stable cooperative foundation.  
• In the "Working Mass" life stage, he has dependant children, a stable income (salary account customer), a credit card limit exceeding 100k, and his primary spending category is "Leisure". He frequently travels for business, owns pets, and leads a diverse lifestyle while bearing family responsibilities.  
• Investment Risk Rating (RPQ) is Level 5; however, cash accounts for as high as 98.4% of asset allocation, with investment products comprising only 1.6% (mainly structured products). This indicates excessive liquidity and underutilized investment potential.  
• In terms of protection, he has not purchased Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS) but holds insurance products (surrender value: 1M–3M, annual premium: 50K–100K), resulting in a medical protection gap. Despite frequent business travel, no relevant travel insurance has been mentioned, leaving room for optimization in the protection system.  
• Digital footprint shows he关注 "Foreign Exchange" topics in the past month and prefers conducting transactions through branches. He has not answered calls from the account manager in the past three months. It is recommended to proactively arrange an in-person meeting to deepen communication through his preferred channel.  
• Action Recommendations: 1) Address family responsibilities and medical protection gaps by promoting Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS) and family medical protection packages; 2) Explore travel insurance and pet insurance needs considering his frequent business travel and pet ownership; 3) Utilize the in-person meeting to optimize cash asset allocation based on risk tolerance (RPQ Level 5) and enhance overall investment returns.  


[Wealth Portfolio]  
• Personalized Investment Advice: The customer’s total relationship balance (TRB) ranges from 3M–8M, with an excessively high cash ratio (98.4%). It is recommended to adjust allocation with reference to the "Aggressive Portfolio" (high risk) – this portfolio has achieved a cumulative return of 118.5% over the past 10 years with a volatility rate of 13.2%, aligning with his RPQ Level 5 risk tolerance. Specifically, consider increasing allocation to global equities (44%) and Asia-Pacific emerging market equities (44%), with moderate allocation to global bonds (12%) to balance risks.  
• Asset Allocation Adjustment Recommendations: Gradually reduce the cash ratio from 98.4% to approximately 12% and reallocate funds to equity and bond assets. Considering he holds structured products (hldg_INV_SP), priority can be given to reinvesting the principal of maturing structured products into the abovementioned assets. Additionally, for the upcoming maturing MXI products (within the next two months), it is recommended not to renew into cash-like products but instead allocate to Asian USD investment-grade bonds (Bloomberg Asian USD Investment Grade Bond Index has risen 5.8% year-to-date with a yield of 4.6%) to achieve stable returns.  
• Investment Portfolio Optimization Opportunities: 1) The customer关注 the foreign exchange market; leveraging the recent RMB appreciation trend (offshore RMB against USD has risen to a near one-month high), recommend RMB-denominated high-dividend equity funds or structured deposits to capture dual opportunities of exchange rate and asset appreciation; 2) Currently holds insurance products with a cash value of 1M–3M; review the policy structure to ensure alignment with retirement reserve goals (Legacy), and adjust premium contributions or switch product types as appropriate; 3) Utilize the "Wealth Master" tool (which the customer has not accessed) to help visualize asset allocation and enhance the digital service experience.  


[Market News]  
• Market Update 1: "A-Share Uptrend Boosts RMB Demand" – Mainland A-shares continue to hit a near 10-year high, driving the RMB exchange rate to a near one-month high. Technically, USD/CNH has broken below the bottom support of the Bollinger Band, with the next support level at 7.1. Relevance to Customer: The customer holds foreign exchange products (hldg_FX) and关注 the foreign exchange market; RMB strength presents an opportunity to convert or allocate to RMB assets. Action Recommendation:建议 convert part of USD cash to RMB or allocate to high-quality RMB-denominated fixed-income products to lock in exchange rate gains.  
• Market Update 2: "Singapore's July CPI Rose by Only 0.6% Year-on-Year" – Inflationary pressures in the Asian region are gradually easing, facilitating regional central banks to maintain accommodative monetary policies and providing justification for the low-interest-rate environment. Relevance to Customer: The yield on the customer’s cash assets may be affected by low interest rates;收益 can be enhanced by allocating to Asian USD high-yield bonds (Bloomberg Asian USD High-Yield Bond Index has risen 6.5% year-to-date with a yield of 7.5%). Action Recommendation: Recommend Asian USD high-yield bond funds as a cash alternative to balance liquidity and收益.  
• Market Update 3: "Performance of Major Bond Indices" – Bloomberg Global Developed Markets Corporate Bond Index has risen 7.4% year-to-date with a yield of 4.5%; Asian USD Investment Grade Bond Index has risen 5.8% with a yield of 4.6%, indicating steady bond market performance.
