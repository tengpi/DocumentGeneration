[Customer Profile]  
• Comprehensive Customer Analysis: 51-60-year-old married male, non-Hong Kong resident from Mainland China, retired (Life Stage: Retired), Prestige Private high-net-worth client. He maintains a close relationship with his relationship manager (Intimate & warm client) and exhibits high bank stickiness (imodel_seg: Intimate). Total Relationship Balance (TRB) exceeds RMB 20 million, with cash assets accounting for 72.24% (both demand deposits and time deposits exceed RMB 5 million). Investment allocation is only 27.76% with a concentrated structure, holding solely structured products and no diversified assets such as bonds or funds. As a "dividend income-focused" (Wealth Persona: Dividend Earner) investor with monthly income exceeding RMB 100,000, excessive cash concentration may hinder passive income goals during retirement. In daily life, he is passionate about gaming (Gaming Fanatics) and frequently travels for business (bustrip: Y). He has no children to support, lives with family, holds a mortgage loan of over RMB 3 million, but has not purchased Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS: N) or any insurance products. Additionally, there are services approaching expiration (expire_risk: Y).  
• Action Recommendations:  
  - Cash Activation: Given the high cash holding ratio, recommend allocating low-volatility income-generating assets to enhance dividend income, aligning with retirement financial goals;  
  - Protection Gap Filling: With increased medical risks post-retirement, prioritise evaluating Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS) and critical illness coverage to fill protection gaps;  
  - Service Renewal: Follow up promptly on expiring services/contracts to ensure continuity of wealth management services;  
  - Life-Focused Solutions: Recommend comprehensive business travel insurance based on frequent business trips, and provide value-added services such as digital memberships in conjunction with gaming hobbies.  


[Wealth Portfolio]  
• Personalised Investment Recommendations: Based on the client’s risk rating (RPQ Level 1, conservative) and dividend preference, the following allocations are recommended:  
  - High-Quality Bonds: Focus on Bloomberg Global Developed Markets Corporate Bonds (up 7.4% year-to-date, yield 4.5%) and Asian USD Investment-Grade Bonds (up 5.8%, yield 4.6%). These assets offer low volatility and stable returns, meeting cash flow needs during retirement;  
  - Dividend Funds: Appropriately allocate to Asia-Pacific high-dividend equity funds (e.g., Hang Seng High Dividend ETF), controlling the proportion at 5%-8% to diversify dividend sources;  
  - Foreign Exchange Wealth Management: The client has recent foreign exchange browsing activity (digital_FX: Y). Consider RMB stablecoin-related products (market rumours suggest the State Council is promoting its internationalisation) or foreign exchange-linked structured deposits to diversify single-currency risks.  
• Asset Allocation Adjustment Plan: The cash proportion of 72.24% is significantly higher than the 12% cash ratio in conservative portfolios; recommend gradual adjustment within 6–12 months:  
  - Reduce cash to 40%-45%: Maintain daily liquidity and emergency funds;  
  - Increase bonds to 35%-40%: Allocate to global investment-grade corporate bonds and Asian USD bonds to replace some low-yield cash;  
  - Structured Product Optimisation: Review dividend returns of existing structured products and replace them with new bond/dividend-linked products in a timely manner to maintain stable investment proportion.  
• Portfolio Optimisation Opportunities:  
  - Mortgage Optimisation: Shanghai has introduced new property policies (lifting purchase restrictions outside the outer ring road, unified mortgage interest rates). Evaluate room for lowering existing mortgage interest rates, with expected monthly interest savings of approximately 0.3%-0.5%;  
  - Cross-Bank Asset Consolidation: The client holds bonds in other banks (fhc_offus_wealth: BOND). Recommend transferring them to our bank to enjoy Prestige Private exclusive rates and one-stop asset management services;  
  - Digital Tool Recommendation: Guide the use of the Wealth Master platform (client has not accessed it) to monitor asset allocation and dividend receipts in real time, improving management efficiency.  


[Market News]  
• Increasing Attractiveness of RMB Assets; Foreign Exchange Allocation Can Enter at Appropriate Timing (Foreign Exchange Market): Federal Reserve Chair Powell hinted at a potential rate cut in September, leading to a weaker US dollar. Coupled with A-shares hitting a near 10-year high driving RMB demand, offshore RMB against USD rose to 7.1584 (near one-month high). Market rumours suggest the State Council is considering promoting the internationalisation of RMB stablecoins, which is expected to further enhance liquidity of RMB assets. Client Implications: Allocate 5%-10% of assets to RMB-denominated short-term wealth management products (e.g., 3-month structured deposits) to capture exchange rate and policy dividends, aligning with his overseas experience background.  
• Shanghai Property Market Policy Eased; Mortgage Loans Have Adjustment Room (Mainland Economy): Shanghai has implemented measures from 26 August, including lifting purchase restrictions outside the outer ring road, increasing provident fund loan limits, and exempting eligible properties from property tax, aiming to boost property market demand. Client Implications: The client has a mortgage of over RMB 3 million; contact the mortgage department to evaluate eligibility for "interest rate reduction" or "loan term optimisation". It is expected that annual interest savings of approximately RMB 15,000–30,000 can be achieved after adjustment, directly increasing disposable income.  
• Global Bonds Perform Steadily, Aligning with Conservative Investment Needs (Fixed Income Market): The Bloomberg Global Developed Markets Corporate Bond Index has risen 7.4% year-to-date with a yield of 4.5%; the Asian USD Investment-Grade Bond Index has risen 5.8% with a yield of 4.6%. Both asset classes have volatility below 3% in the past 3 months, with controllable risks. Client Implications: Reallocate 20%-25% of cash to the above bond products, with expected annualised return of 4%-4.5%. This will supplement dividend income, align with his low risk tolerance (RPQ Level 1), and increase returns by approximately 3–4 times compared to demand deposits.n
